## Golang FTW!

This repo documents my journey as I learn Golang and get comfortable building services in it.

### Why Go?

I personally believe Golang is the best language for APIs and backends because of its:

- Low learning curve
- Concurrency model
- Static typing
- Compilation
- Code style baked into the language
- Strictness

### Why not other languages?

One could create backends in other languages, but in my opinion, here are their deficiencies when compated to Go:

- Node: Need to add TypeScript, and the result is a much bigger mess. Plus, can't do CPU-intensive work easily.
- Java/C++: Too complicated and too many concepts/frameworks to learn before one can get started.
- PHP/Python/Ruby: Overall performance is too poor, plus no or poor real-time support (WebSockets)

### Conclusion

Go is annoying at times, sure, but I think the benefits outweight the costs clearly. Happy Go!
